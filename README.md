# Executing-CGI-program-using-Python-with-XAMPP-server
A simple webpage designed by adding photos,audio and video files with CGI script using python code
This program is a demo on how to execute a CGI program using XAMPP server...If you want to execute a .py file which includes html script, then we need a webserver to be installed. And then ...in that xampp config...we have to include .py in AddHandler ....then start the xampp server and then ... add the python file location in test.py file as first line(commented)....and then open a browser and then run the program as localhost/pycgi/test.py
